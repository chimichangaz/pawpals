PawPals is a mobile application designed for pet owners who want a dedicated space to connect, share, and build local communities around their pets. The app combines the functionality of a social platform with tools for real-world interaction. Users can create profiles, upload and share pictures, post updates, and engage with others through comments and discussions. In addition to the content-sharing features, PawPals supports the organization of local meetups, allowing pet owners to discover nearby events and connect with like-minded individuals.

The project is built using React Native for a cross-platform mobile experience and Firebase as the backend for authentication, data storage, and media management. Future development plans include integrating AI features such as a chatbot for pet care FAQs and personalized recommendations for potential pet friends and events.
